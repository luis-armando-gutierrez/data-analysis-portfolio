# Used Car Price Analysis (Regression)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the market price of used vehicles using machine learning regression techniques. The objective is to understand which vehicle characteristics most strongly influence price and to build a predictive model that supports data-driven pricing decisions.

The project was developed as part of an introductory machine learning workflow, covering data preparation, feature analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Business Problem
Accurately pricing used vehicles is critical for automotive marketplaces and dealerships. Overpriced vehicles reduce demand, while underpriced vehicles lead to revenue loss. A data-driven pricing model helps optimize competitiveness and profitability.

---

## Data Preparation
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Handled missing values and inconsistent entries.
- Analyzed numerical and categorical features related to vehicle characteristics.
- Prepared the dataset for regression modeling.

---

## Modeling Approach
- Formulated the problem as a **regression task** with vehicle price as the target variable.
- Trained baseline machine learning models to predict prices.
- Compared model performance to identify the most effective approach.
- Analyzed feature importance to understand key price drivers.

---

## Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using standard regression metrics to assess prediction accuracy and error. Performance comparisons were used to balance model complexity and interpretability.

---

## Key Insights
- Vehicle age and mileage have a strong negative impact on price.
- Certain vehicle characteristics significantly influence market value.
- Machine learning models can provide reliable price estimates when supported by proper data preparation.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Outcome
This project demonstrates a complete regression workflow, from raw data preparation to model evaluation, highlighting how machine learning can support pricing strategies in real-world business scenarios.
